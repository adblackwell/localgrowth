# localgrowth
The localgrowth package provides functions to calculate z-scores and centile values for measurements of height, weight, and BMI based on both widely used growth standards and references (CDC, WHO) and references from other populations (Tsimane, Shuar). The included LMS files are for calculating height-for-age, weight-for-age, BMI-for-age, and weight-for-height z-scores.
